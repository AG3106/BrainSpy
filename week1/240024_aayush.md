# Week 1 Assignment
## Edge Detection:
Image was loaded using OpenCV and converted to grayscale.<br>
Three types of filters were tried sobel, scharr and prewitt.
### General method to apply Filter:
1. Horizontal and vertical kernels of filter were used to detect edges.
2. Gradients of image were generated using convolution of image with kernel.
3. Final image was generated by combining both gradients.

### Evaluation:

Scharr Filter generated edges with high intensity. This led to some edges to merge together. <br>
Sobel Filter had less intensity but had same problem. <br>
Prewitt Filter was least intense and generated very clear and accurate edges.
